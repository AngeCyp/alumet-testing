# Alumet agent

This crate contains the alumet agent: a binary crate (i.e. runnable application) that is able to monitor and/or profile
things on a system. It depends on the core of Alumet, plus a set of static plugins.

See [the Alumet user book](https://alumet-dev.github.io/user-book/) to learn how to use it.
